We show that the level of presence impacts free spatial exploration behavior in a large scale VR navigation paradigm. Here, we investigate the impact of an established presence metric on ongoing motor behavior demonstrating an analysis framework with a high spatial resolution. We observed participants with higher presence exhibit presumably higher spatial awareness by spending more time at navigationally relevant segments. Ultimately, we link presence to individual differences in video game experience, sex, and spatial perspective taking abilities, confirming that user characteristics are a defining part of the presence constructy spending more time at navigationally relevant segments. Ultimately, we link presence to individual differences in video game experience, sex, and spatial perspective taking abilities, confirming that user characteristics are a defining part of the presence construct.
%Video game experience, biological sex as well as spatial perspective taking skills proved to be significant predictors of a rich presence experience and were able to predict presence to within 3/4 of a point accuracy on a standard questionnaire scale.

%The use of head-mounted virtual reality (VR) to induce presence in a computer simulated world has proven to significantly increase the ecological validity of this medium. In VR, illusions of various kinds (place illusion, plausibility illusion, etc.) occur at the same time for the user to feel present. Most prominently, the embodiment illusion has proven to elicit 'realistic' behavioral as well as physiological responses, when a strong emotional stimulus such as virtual hurting of an embodied rubber hand is provided. Yet, to be able to employ VR and claim ecological validity for less emotional stimuli, the level of presence must be accounted for. .
