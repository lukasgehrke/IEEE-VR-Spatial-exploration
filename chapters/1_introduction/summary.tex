Here, we investigated the impact of experienced presence on spatial exploration behavior in the invisible maze task~\cite{gehrke2018}. We administered the igroup presence questionnaire after participants explored four different mazes repeatedly for about one hour. For the reported analyses we assessed only the first item of the questionnaire, assessing presence on a general level~\cite{igroup}.

The main objective of the presented analyses was to address whether spatial exploration behavior differs as a function of experienced presence. We used mass-univariate statistical modeling to construct parametric maps of the effect of experienced presence on where participants spent time in the maze and where participants touched the walls.
