\subsubsection{Assessing presence} To assess experienced presence, we administered the igroup presence questionnaire after participants explored four different mazes repeatedly for about one hour \cite{Schubert2003}. For the reported analyses we considered only the first item of the questionnaire, the subjective presence measure (G1) is representing the sense of being in a place, i.e. 'In the computer generated world I had a sense of "being there' rated from 'not at all' to 'very much' \cite{Schubert2003, Slater1993}.
