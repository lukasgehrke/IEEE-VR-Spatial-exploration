\subsection{Statistical Analyses II} To enrich our analysis we strove for a greater spatial resolution of movement behavior. A general average of, e.g. movement velocity, is limited in insight due to its spatial dependence. Therefore, we constructed two-dimensional, spatial, parametric maps of the movement behavior parameters. For the different parameters, a histogram was calculated with fixed edges for each maze to be able to compare the maps across subjects. Furthermore a gaussian blur was applied to the histogram image to broaden the data and hence increase the overlap between subjects.

% Maps: heatmap head location, head velocity, wall touch location, hand jerk 2nd level: regression of presence on movement parameters, simple mcc and sig mask
