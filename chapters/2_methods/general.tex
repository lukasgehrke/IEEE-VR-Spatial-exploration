\subsection{Participants} Thirty-two healthy participants (aged 21--45 years, 14 men) took part in the
experiment. All participants gave written informed consent to participation and the experimental protocol was approved by the local ethics committee (protocol: GR\_08\_20170428). Three participants were excluded from data analysis due to incomplete data or difficulties in complying with the task requirements.

\subsection{Assessing experienced presence} In the current work, we were interested in the subjectively reported experience of presence. Therefore we analyzed the first item on 'igroup's presence questionnaire', i.e. 'In the computer generated world I had a sense of "being there"' rated from 'not at all' to 'very much'~\cite{ipq, slaterQ1}.
