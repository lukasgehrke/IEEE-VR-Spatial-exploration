\subsection{Procedure and Task}
\subsubsection{The Invisible Maze Task} Participants freely explored a sparse invisible maze environment interactively by walking and probing for visual feedback when touching the virtual wall with their hand. All stimuli were presented using an Oculus Rift DK2 VR headset. Upon collision of the hand with an invisible wall, an illuminated white disc was displayed 30 cm behind the collision point parallel to the invisible wall (Fig. \ref{imt_task} C) (see ~\cite{Gehrke2018} for further details on the task, instrumentation, and data collection). In summary, the task required participants to explore mazes to build a spatial representation of the maze layout. Four different mazes (Fig. \ref{imt_task} B) were explored each in three consecutive runs. Doing the task, participants display a behavior that is comparable to explorative wall touches in the dark to find your way. We collected synchronized motion capture and behavioral events alongside high-density Electroencephalogry (EEG).
