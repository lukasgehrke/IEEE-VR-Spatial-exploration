stepwise regression with IPQ Presence scale as well as IPQ Spatial Presence scale

interesting:
spatial presence is best predicted by time on task and the sketchmaps, whereas general presence is best predicted by video game experience and sex (there is evidence of sex and videogame influence in slater work etc.). Interestingly, in our experiment video game experience negatively impacts presence reported on the general item of the IPQ. This may be due to the overly simplistic visuals of the virtual world. Participants with significant video gaming experience might perceive the world as too artificial.
