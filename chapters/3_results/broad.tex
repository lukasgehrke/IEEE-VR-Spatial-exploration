\subsection{Video Game Experience, Gender and Perspective Taking predict experienced Presence} Running stepwise model selection resulted in three predictors being kept, explaining 53,4\% of the variation in experienced presence ($F_{(3,25)}=11.69, p < .001,$ adjusted $R^2=.534$). Participants' predicted presence is equal to 8.15 - 1.2 (Video Game Experience) + 2.61 (SEX) - 0.02 (PTSOT) where sex is coded as 1 = Male, 2 = Female, video game experience is higher in higher scores and perspective taking ability is worse in higher scores. Video game experience ($t_{(25)}=-4.7, p<.001$), sex ($t_{(25)}=5.6, p<.001$) as well as perspective taking ability ($t_{(25)}=-2.52, p<.05$) were significant predictors of presence.

Training the three predictor model above for each of five different folds of the data and evaluating its performance on the held-out fold yields a combined average .76 mean absolute error. Hence, using video game experience, sex as well as perspective taking ability we can predict experienced presence to within three-quarters of a point accuracy.
