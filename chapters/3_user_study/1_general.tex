\section{3 user study}
To promote our proposal of investigating moderators of VR experience via spatially resolved parametric maps, we challenge whether the level of experienced presence impacts spatial exploration behavior in a large VR. Our invisible maze task mimics a real-world exploration situation such as finding your way in complete darkness \cite{}. We conducted the following two-step analysis. First, we constructed parametric maps to assess where participants movement behavior was impacted as a function of experienced presence. To this end, we conducted mass-univariate pixel-by-pixel modeling of experienced presence on duration spent at each location, i.e. pixel. Zooming out, we followed up our findings with a classification scheme predicting experienced presence given per participant descriptors. We considered a data-driven approach to finding a useful, i.e. scalable, classification model. Therefore, we initially included a variety of participant descriptors subsequently reducing them to a set with highest explanatory power. In this way, we hope to present a minimal model so other researchers may easily reproduce our findings.

%To sum up, we addressed how accurate subjectively reported presence may be predicted given a number of per participant descriptors.

%Here, we propose a highly accurate subjective presence metric based on individual differences in video game experience, sex, and spatial perspective taking abilities. Furthermore, we show that the level of presence impacts free spatial exploration behavior in a large scale VR during a spatial navigation paradigm. Finally, using a methodological framework developed for the cognitive neuroscience, we showcase a powerful analysis framework to investigate ongoing behavior in cognitive paradigms in greater detail.

\subsection{Participants, Procedure, Task and Setup} Thirty-two healthy participants (aged 21--45 years, 14 men) took part in the experiment. All participants gave written informed consent to participation and the experimental protocol was approved by the local ethics committee (protocol: GR\_08\_20170428). Three participants were excluded from data analysis due to incomplete data or difficulties in complying with task requirements.

\subsubsection{The Invisible Maze Task} Participants freely explored a sparse invisible maze environment interactively by walking and probing for visual feedback when touching the virtual wall of a 1m wide path with their \textit{right} hand. All stimuli were presented using an Oculus Rift DK2 VR headset which was adaptable to be incorporated with the dedicated optical tracking system. Further the DK2 headset offered benefits regarding weight and modifiability. Upon collision of the \textit{right} hand with an invisible wall, a white disc was displayed 30 cm behind the collision point parallel to the invisible wall much like the beam form a torch in a cave, see figure \ref{imt_task} C (consult \cite{} for extensive details on the task, instrumentation, and data collection). We did not track the left hand and instructed participants to keep along their body. Performing the task, participants explored four different mazes in order, `I', `L', `Z' and `U', see f \ref{imt_task} B). The task was designed to emphasize participants internal build-up of a spatial representation of the maze layout. Doing the task, participants display a behavior that is comparable to explorative wall touches in the dark to find your way.

For each maze the procedure was as follows: participants were briefly disoriented and then positioned facing the open side of the path. Then, participants were directed to explore the invisible path until they reached a dead end, and subsequently find their way back to the starting position. At the end of each maze trial, participants received a gamified feedback and were then asked to draw a sketch map of the maze from a bird’s eye view as an index of spatial learning. The procedure was repeated three times in a row for each maze to foster spatial learning. For the present analysis, the three exploration phases were aggregated. The complete experiment, including preparation of physiological measures (Electroencephalogram, EEG) took approximately 4 hours. Preceding and following the task participants completed a set of questionnaires. We collected synchronized motion capture and behavioral events alongside high-density EEG.

\subsubsection{Assessing presence} To assess experienced presence, we administered the igroup presence questionnaire \cite{Schubert2003}. For the reported analyses we considered only the first item of the questionnaire, the subjective presence measure (G1) is representing the sense of being in a place, i.e. 'In the computer generated world I had a sense of "being there' rated from 'not at all' to 'very much' on a 7-point Likert scale \cite{Schubert2003, Slater1993}.
