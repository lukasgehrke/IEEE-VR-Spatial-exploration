\subsubsection{Assessing presence objectively and continuously}
The problem that we do assess it using non-continuous metrics with a time delay of administration~\cite{Gehrke:2019:DVM:3290605.3300657}. why it is interesting to look at objective predictors of presence experience?

% what to cite:
One way is through observing predictors in overt behavior, another way allowing to detect experienced presence is to go directly to the source of the signal, i.e. the brain \cite{Gehrke:2019:DVM:3290605.3300657}.
% add a sentence or two about the paper and similar work it cited, building interfaces that are 'neuroaware' and adapt their behavior based on closed-loop feedback from the brain.
