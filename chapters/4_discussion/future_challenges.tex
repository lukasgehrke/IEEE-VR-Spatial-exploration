say that behavioral metrics not informative enough in terms of presence with broad resolution, and that a finer resolution is beneficial.

Here, we addressed a potential link between presence and accuracy of motor behavior on broad scale, i.e. in an unconstrained navigation paradigm. 

The problem that we do assess it using non-continuous metrics with a time delay of administration~\cite{gehrkeakman2019}

Complexity of presence as a psychological construct and that it may interact with spatial learning and task difficulty among other things~\cite{} % gonzales-castro model
