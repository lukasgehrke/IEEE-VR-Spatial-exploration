\subsection{Exploration behavior expressed as a function of presence} 
First, averaging spatially-resolved exploration time across participants revealed that participants spent more time in dead-ends as well as in areas including corners. The effect was observed across all mazes (see red colors in figure \ref{head_loc_mean}). Conversely, less time was spent when located in the straight segments of each maze, i.e. participants moved faster in those segments. As expected, participants also spent more time at the beginning of the trial, taking a moment to start moving. Together, these findings confirmed our intuitive expectations of the exploration behavior. 

Second, we investigated the effect of presence on time spent exploring mass-univariately for all locations in all mazes. With increasing presence scores, time spent at the center of the straight paths increased, for example in maze `I' at [3.5, 1.5] $beta=.027, t_{(28)}=2.76, p=.01, R^2=.23$ and `Z' at [1.8, 10] $beta=.039, t_{(28)}=3.34, p<.01, R^2=.34$, see figure \ref{presence_head_loc} A. Further, increasing presence scores correlated with more time spent at the center of the paths in corners, for example in maze `L' at [-1, 3.5] $beta=.037, t_{(28)}=2.33, p=.03, R^2=.19$ and `U' at [0.5, 17.5] $beta=.034, t_{(28)}=2.44, p=.02, R^2=.19$. Conversely, closer to the maze boundaries we observed a negative effect with increasing presence scores correlating with less time spent in these areas, specifically in the most challenging mazes `Z' at [2, 11.5] $beta=-.073, t_{(28)}=-4.16, p<.01, R^2=.40$ and `U' at [0.5, 17] $beta=-.143, t_{(28)}=-4.05 p<.01, R^2=.40$. Taken together, with an increase in experienced presence, participants spent more time firmly located at the center of the path, specifically along the straight segments in the `I' and `Z' maze as well in navigationally relevant corners of mazes `L', `Z' and `U'. Further underlining this observation, higher reported presence scores negatively correlated with the time spent close or even colliding with the maze walls.
