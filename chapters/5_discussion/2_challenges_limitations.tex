%- say that behavioral metrics not informative enough in terms of presence with broad resolution, and that a finer resolution is beneficial. Here, we addressed a potential link between presence and accuracy of motor behavior on broad scale, i.e. in an unconstrained navigation paradigm. 
%- Complexity of presence as a psychological construct and that it may interact with spatial learning and task difficulty among other things~\cite{} % gonzales-castro model
%- Increasing the resolution of the investigation to finely resolved analysis in space. Motion capture allows us to do that. 
%- statistics can be extended to using resampling methods, see pernet limo, spm etc.
