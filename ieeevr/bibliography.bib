abstract = {Advances in tracking technology and wireless headsets enable walking as a means of locomotion in Virtual Reality. When exploring virtual environments larger than room-scale, it is often desirable to increase users' perceived walking speed, for which we investigate three methods. (1) Ground-Level Scaling increases users' avatar size, allowing them to walk farther. (2) Eye-Level Scaling enables users to walk through a World in Miniature, while maintaining a street-level view. (3) Seven-League Boots amplifies users' movements along their walking path. We conduct a study comparing these methods and find that users feel most embodied using Ground-Level Scaling and consequently increase their stride length. Using Seven-League Boots, unlike the other two methods, diminishes positional accuracy at high gains, and users modify their walking behavior to compensate for the lack of control. We conclude with a discussion on each technique's strength and weaknesses and the types of situation they might be appropriate for.},

abstract = {An illusory sensation of ownership over a surrogate limb or whole body can be induced through specific forms of multisensory stimulation, such as synchronous visuotactile tapping on the hidden real and visible rubber hand in the rubber hand illusion. Such methods have been used to induce ownership over a manikin and a virtual body that substitute the real body, as seen from first-person perspective, through a head-mounted display. However, the perceptual and behavioral consequences of such transformed body ownership have hardly been explored. In Exp. 1, immersive virtual reality was used to embody 30 adults as a 4-y-old child (condition C), and as an adult body scaled to the same height as the child (condition A), experienced from the first-person perspective, and with virtual and real body movements synchronized. The result was a strong body-ownership illusion equally for C and A. Moreover there was an overestimation of the sizes of objects compared with a nonembodied baseline, which was significantly greater for C compared with A. An implicit association test showed that C resulted in significantly faster reaction times for the classification of self with child-like compared with adult-like attributes. Exp. 2 with an additional 16 participants extinguished the ownership illusion by using visuomotor asynchrony, with all else equal. The size-estimation and implicit association test differences between C and A were also extinguished. We conclude that there are perceptual and probably behavioral correlates of body-ownership illusions that occur as a function of the type of body in which embodiment occurs. {\textcopyright} PNAS 2013.},

abstract = {Relationships between neuroimaging measures and behavior provide important clues about brain function and cognition in healthy and clinical populations. While electroencephalography (EEG) provides a portable, low cost measure of brain dynamics, it has been somewhat underrepresented in the emerging field of model-based inference. We seek to address this gap in this article by highlighting the utility of linking EEG and behavior, with an emphasis on approaches for EEG analysis that move beyond focusing on peaks or “components” derived from averaging EEG responses across trials and subjects (generating the event-related potential, ERP). First, we review methods for deriving features from EEG in order to enhance the signal within single-trials. These methods include filtering based on user-defined features (i.e., frequency decomposition, time-frequency decomposition), filtering based on data-driven properties (i.e., blind source separation, BSS), and generating more abstract representations of data (e.g., using deep learning). We then review cognitive models which extract latent variables from experimental tasks, including the drift diffusion model (DDM) and reinforcement learning (RL) approaches. Next, we discuss ways to access associations among these measures, including statistical models, data-driven joint models and cognitive joint modeling using hierarchical Bayesian models (HBMs). We think that these methodological tools are likely to contribute to theoretical advancements, and will help inform our understandings of brain dynamics that contribute to moment-to-moment cognitive function.},

abstract = {Generative models of 3D human motion are often restricted to a small number of activities and can therefore not generalize well to novel movements or applications. In this work we propose a deep learning framework for human motion capture data that learns a generic representation from a large corpus of motion capture data and generalizes well to new, unseen, motions. Using an encoding-decoding network that learns to predict future 3D poses from the most recent past, we extract a feature representation of human motion. Most work on deep learning for sequence prediction focuses on video and speech. Since skeletal data has a different structure, we present and evaluate different network architectures that make different assumptions about time dependencies and limb correlations. To quantify the learned features, we use the output of different layers for action classification and visualize the receptive fields of the network units. Our method outperforms the recent state of the art in skeletal motion prediction even though these use action specific training data. Our results show that deep feedforward networks, trained from a generic mocap database, can successfully be used for feature extraction from human motion data and that this representation can be used as a foundation for classification and prediction.},

abstract = {Brains, it has recently been argued, are essentially prediction machines. They are bundles of cells that support perception and action by constantly attempting to match incoming sensory inputs with top-down expectations or predictions. This is achieved using a hierarchical generative model that aims to minimize prediction error within a bidirectional cascade of cortical processing. Such accounts offer a unifying model of perception and action, illuminate the functional role of attention, and may neatly capture the special contribution of cortical processing to adaptive success. This target article critically examines this hierarchical prediction machine approach, concluding that it offers the best clue yet to the shape of a unified science of mind and action. Sections 1 and 2 lay out the key elements and implications of the approach. Section 3 explores a variety of pitfalls and challenges, spanning the evidential, the methodological, and the more properly conceptual. The paper ends (sections 4 and 5) by asking how such approaches might impact our more general vision of mind, experience, and agency. {\textcopyright} 2013 Cambridge University Press.},

In order to improve our understanding of this phenomenon, literature about gender differences in spatial orientation skills is reviewed from 1983 to 2003. The influence of biological and socio/cultural factors is discussed as well as the hypothesis that gender differences are due to different strategies used to solve orientation tasks. The role of personality factors and the influence of spatial anxiety in orientation performance are also discussed. An additional interpretative hypothesis is proposed highlighting the role of task-difficulty expressed in terms of Visuo-Spatial Working Memory involvement.

Pan and Hamilton (2018, Br. J. Psychol.) provide a useful overview of methodological recommendations for using VR. Here, we highlight some other aspects of the use of VR. Our first argument is that VR can be useful by virtue of its differences from the normal perceptual environment. That is, by virtue of its relative non-realism and poverty of its perceptual elements, it can actually offer increased clarity with respect to the features of interest for the researcher. Our second argument is that VR exerts its measurable influence more by eliciting an acceptance of the virtual world (i.e., ‘suspension of disbelief') rather than by eliciting a true belief of the realism of the VR environment. We conclude by providing a novel suggestion for combining neuroimaging methods with embodied VR that relies on the suspension of disbelief.},

abstract = {Background: Quantitative measures of human movement quality are important for discriminating healthy and pathological conditions and for expressing the outcomes and clinically important changes in subjects' functional state. However the most frequently used instruments for the upper extremity functional assessment are clinical scales, that previously have been standardized and validated, but have a high subjective component depending on the observerwho scores the test. But they are not enough to assess motor strategies used duringmovements, and their use in combination with other more objective measures is necessary. The objective of the present review is to provide an overviewon objective metrics found in literature with the aimof quantifying the upper extremity performance during functional tasks, regardless of the equipment or system used for registering kinematic data. Methods: A search inMedline, Google Scholar and IEEE Xplore databases was performed following a combination of a series of keywords. The full scientific papers that fulfilled the inclusion criteria were included in the review. Findings: A set of kinematicmetricswas found in literature in relation to joint displacements, analysis of hand trajectories and velocity profiles. Thesemetrics were classified into different categories according to themovement characteristic that was being measured. Interpretation: These kinematic metrics provide the starting point for a proposed objective metrics for the functional assessment of the upper extremity in people with movement disorders as a consequence of neurological injuries.

VR offers major benefits in terms of ecological validity, experimental control and options to track behavioral responses. However, navigation in the real world differs from navigation in VR in several aspects. In addition, the importance of body-based or visual cues for navigation varies between animal species. Incongruences between sensory and motor input in VR might consequently affect their performance to a different degree. After discussing the specifics of using VR in spatial navigation research across species, we outline several challenges when investigating age-related deficits in spatial navigation with the help of VR. In addition, we discuss ways to reduce their impact, together with the possibilities VR offers for improving navigational abilities in older adults.},

Participants (N=40) were randomly assigned to either an experimental group giving a presentation in front of a virtual audience or a control group merely imagining the audience. Significant differences between male and female participants were found on all presence subscales (Spatial Presence, Realness, Sense of Being There) except for Involvement. Men generally reported a higher sense of spatial presence, more perceived realism and higher levels of the sense of actually being in the environment than women. The inclusion of social interaction anxiety as a covariate revealed a significant influence only on the Sense of Being There.

The most established sorts of statistical parametric maps (e.g., Friston et al. [1991]: J Cereb Blood Flow Metab 11:690–699; Worsley et al. [1992]: J Cereb Blood Flow Metab 12:900–918) are based on linear models, for example ANCOVA, correlation coefficients and t tests. In the sense that these examples are all special cases of the general linear model it should be possible to implement them (and many others) within a unified framework. We present here a general approach that accomodates most forms of experimental layout and ensuing analysis (designed experiments with fixed effects for factors, covariates and interaction of factors). This approach brings together two well established bodies of theory (the general linear model and the theory of Gaussian fields) to provide a complete and simple framework for the analysis of imaging data. The importance of this framework is twofold: (i) Conceptual and mathematical simplicity, in that the same small number of operational equations is used irrespective of the complexity of the experiment or nature of the statistical model and (ii) the generality of the framework provides for great latitude in experimental design and analysis. {\textcopyright} 1995 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

In these group stands out the insoles that must be manufactured to meet specific requirements. However, the currently employed manufacturing method brings disadvantages, hinders mass production and, in parallel, the materials used do not achieve the required maximum performance. It is known also that there are a reasonable number of pathologies associated with the foot which implies the production of specialized insoles. In this dissertation, involve the production of foams for orthopedic shoes insoles aiming to circumvent some of these problems. These resulted from a mixture of two base resins, EVA/HDPE, and using compression molding. In the first phase a reasonable amount of preselected formulations were produced and characterized. In the second phase we selected the best formulation found in the previous step and the parameters of the manufacturing process were adjusted in order to improve the produced foam properties. Simultaneously a new mold was designed, machined and tested aiming to achieve some improvements on the produced foams. Finally, a proposal for industrialization of the insoles manufacturing process was established, which faces the limitations associated with currently employed method. The tests performed during the preliminary studies showed that the produced formulation properties were below the ones of the foam used as a reference, Poron, the most problematic was the permeability to water vapor. On the second phase of the study changes in the processing of foams were implemented and the produced foam blocks were drilled. The results were in general positive conclusion is therefore that the introduction of the drilling step was a crucial step for the success of the study.

abstract = {The neuroscientific study of human navigation has been constrained by the prerequisite of traditional brain imaging studies that require participants to remain stationary. Such imaging approaches neglect a central component that characterizes navigation - the multisensory experience of self-movement. Navigation by active movement through space combines multisensory perception with internally generated self-motion cues. We investigated the spatial microgenesis during free ambulatory exploration of interactive sparse virtual environments using motion capture synchronized to high resolution electroencephalographic (EEG) data as well AS psychometric and self-report measures. In such environments, map-like allocentric representations must be constructed out of transient, egocentric first-person perspective 3-D spatial information. Considering individual differences of spatial learning ability, we studied if changes in exploration behavior coincide with spatial learning of an environment. To this end, we analyzed the quality of sketch maps (a description of spatial learning) that were produced after repeated learning trials for differently complex maze environments. We observed significant changes in active exploration behavior from the first to the last exploration of a maze: a decrease in time spent in the maze predicted an increase in subsequent sketch map quality. Furthermore, individual differences in spatial abilities as well as differences in the level of experienced immersion had an impact on the quality of spatial learning. Our results demonstrate converging evidence of observable behavioral changes associated with spatial learning in a framework that allows the study of cortical dynamics of navigation.},

The effect can be robust enough for participants to respond "realistically," meaning behaviors are altered as if subjects had been exposed to the scenarios in reality. The circumstances in which such VR illusions take place were first introduced in the 80's. Since then, rigorous empirical evidence has explored a wide set of illusory experiences in VR. Here, we compile this research and propose a neuroscientific model explaining the underlying perceptual and cognitive mechanisms that enable illusions in VR. Furthermore, we describe the minimum instrumentation requirements to support illusory experiences in VR, and discuss the importance and shortcomings of the generic model.},

abstract = {Inside virtual reality, users can embody avatars that are collocated from a first-person perspective. When doing so, participants have the feeling that the own body has been substituted by the self-avatar, and that the new body is the source of the sensations. Embodiment is complex as it includes not only body ownership over the avatar, but also agency, co-location, and external appearance. Despite the multiple variables that influence it, the illusion is quite robust, and it can be produced even if the self-avatar is of a different age, size, gender, or race from the participant's own body. Embodiment illusions are therefore the basis for many social VR experiences and a current active research area among the community. Researchers are interested both in the body manipulations that can be accepted, as well as studying how different self-avatars produce different attitudinal, social, perceptual, and behavioral effects. However, findings suggest that despite embodiment being strongly associated with the performance and reactions inside virtual reality, the extent to which the illusion is experienced varies between participants. In this paper, we review the questionnaires used in past experiments and propose a standardized embodiment questionnaire based on 25 questions that are prevalent in the literature. We encourage future virtual reality experiments that include first-person virtual avatars to administer this questionnaire in order to evaluate the degree of embodiment.},

abstract = {The primary function of the human brain is arguably to optimize the results of our motor actions in an ever-changing environment. Our cognitive processes and supporting brain dynamics are inherently coupled both to our environment and to our physical structure and actions. To investigate human cognition in its most natural forms demands imaging of brain activity while participants perform naturally motivated actions and interactions within a full three-dimensional environment. Transient, distributed brain activity patterns supporting spontaneous motor actions, performed in pursuit of naturally motivated goals, may involve any or all parts of cortex and must be precisely timed at a speed faster than the speed of thought and action. Hemodynamic imaging methods give information about brain dynamics on a much slower scale, and established techniques for imaging brain dynamics in all modalities forbid participants from making natural extensive movements so as to avoid intractable movement-related artifacts. To overcome these limitations, we are developing mobile brain/body imaging (MoBI) approaches to study natural human cognition. By synchronizing lightweight, high-density electroencephalographic (EEG) recording with recordings of participant sensory experience, body and eye movements, and other physiological measures, we can apply advanced data analysis techniques to the recorded signal ensemble. This MoBI approach enables the study of human brain dynamics accompanying active human cognition in its most natural forms. Results from our studies have provided new insights into the brain dynamics supporting natural cognition and can extend theories of human cognition and its evolutionary function - to optimize the results of our behavior to meet ever-changing goals, challenges, and opportunities. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Three experiments investigated spatial orientation in a virtual navigation task. Subjects had to adjust a homing vector indicating their end position relative to the origin of the path. It was demonstrated that sparse visual flow was sufficient for accurate path integration. Moreover, subjects were found to prefer a distinct egocentric or allocentric reference frame to solve the task. "Turners" reacted as if they had taken on the new orientation during turns of the path by mentally rotating their sagittal axis (egocentric frame). "Nonturners," by contrast, tracked the new orientation without adopting it (allocentric frame). When instructed to use their nonpreferred reference frame, both groups displayed no decline in response accuracy relative to their preferred frame; even when presented with reaction formats based on either ego or allocentric coordinates, with format unpredictable on a trial, both groups responded highly accurately. These findings support the assumption of coexisting spatial representations during navigation.},

abstract = {The intention of this article is to create a link between human spatial cognition research and architectural design. We conducted an empirical study with human subjects in a complex multi-level building and compared thinking aloud protocols and performance measures of experienced and inexperienced participants in different wayfinding tasks. Three specific strategies for navigation in multi-level buildings were compared. The central point strategy relies on well-known parts of the building; the direction strategy relies on routes that first head towards the horizontal position of the goal, while the floor strategy relies on routes that first head towards the vertical position of the goal. We show that the floor strategy was preferred by experienced participants over the other strategies and was overall tied to better wayfinding performance. Route knowledge showed a greater impact on wayfinding performance compared to survey knowledge. A cognitive-architectural analysis of the building revealed seven possible causes for navigation problems. Especially the staircase design was identified as a major wayfinding obstacle. Finally we address the benefits of cognitive approaches for the architectural design process and describe some open issues for further research. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

But how do we determine the extent to which a user feels present in the virtual environment? This chapter examines three categories of methods commonly used for measuring presence; their use in the field, advantages, and disadvantages. Subjective measures rely on self-assessment by the user. Users answer questions such as "How real did the environment seem to you?", "Was the environment like a place you visited, or a series of images presented to you?". Behavioral measures examine actions or manners exhibited by the user that are responses to objects or events in the virtual environment. For example, does the user duck if a virtual object is thrown at his head. Physiological methods attempt to measure presence by gauging changes in the subject's heart rate, skin temperature, skin conductance, breathing rate, etc. In a stress-inducing virtual environment does the user exhibit physiological signs of stress? How do these methods compare when using the criteria of reliability, validity, objectivity, and sensitivity.},

abstract = {What does it feel like to own, to control, and to be inside a body? The multidimensional nature of this experience together with the continuous presence of one's biological body, render both theoretical and experimental approaches problematic. Nevertheless, exploitation of immersive virtual reality has allowed a reframing of this question to whether it is possible to experience the same sensations towards a virtual body inside an immersive virtual environment as toward the biological body, and if so, to what extent. The current paper addresses these issues by referring to the Sense of Embodiment (SoE). Due to the conceptual confusion around this sense, we provide a working definition which states that SoE consists of three subcomponents: the sense of self-location, the sense of agency, and the sense of body ownership. Under this proposed structure, measures and experimental manipulations reported in the literature are reviewed and related challenges are outlined. Finally, future experimental studies are proposed to overcome those challenges, toward deepening the concept of SoE and enhancing it in virtual applications. {\textcopyright} 2012 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.},

abstract = {Although many studies have indicated that spatialized sounds increase the subjective sense of presence in virtual environments, few studies have examined the effects of sounds objectively. In this study, we examined whether three-dimensional reproduced sounds increase the sense of presence in auditory virtual environments by using physiological and psychological measures. We presented the sounds of people approaching the listener through a three-dimensional reproduction system using 96 loudspeakers. There were two spatial sound conditions, spatialized and non-spatialized, which had different spatial accuracy of the reproduction. The experimental results showed that presence ratings for spatialized sounds were greater than for non-spatialized sounds. Further, the results of the physiological measures showed that the sympathetic nervous system was activated to a greater extent by the spatialized sounds compared with the non-spatialized sounds, and the responses to the three-dimensional reproduced sounds were similar to those that occur during intrusions into personal space in the real world. Additionally, a correlation was found between the psychological and the physiological responses in the spatialized sound condition. These results suggest that the physiological measures correlate to the perceived presence in acoustic environments.},

It therefore has the potential to be a valuable research tool for studies in human-environment interaction, such as building usability studies and post- as well as pre-occupancy building evaluation in architectural research and practice. In order to fully understand VR as a valid environmental representation, it is essential to examine to what extent not only user cognition and behavior, but also users' experiences are analogous in real and virtual environments. This work presents a multi-method approach with two studies that investigated the correspondence of building users' experience in a real conference center and a highly-detailed virtual model of the same building as well as a third study that virtually implemented systematic redesigns to the existing building layout. In the context of reporting users' experiential building evaluations, this article discusses the potential, prerequisites and opportunities for the implementation of virtual environments as an empirical research tool in the field of human-environment interaction. Based on quantitative data, few statistically significant differences between ratings of the real and the virtual building were found; however analyses based on qualitative data revealed differences relating to atmospherics. The main conclusion of this article is that VR has a strong potential to be used as an empirical research tool in psychological and architectural research and that future studies could supplement behavioral validation.},

Recent studies have considered whether it is possible to change our implicit social bias by experimentally changing the relationship between the self and outgroups. In a number of experimental studies, participants have been exposed to bodily illusions that induced ownership over a body different to their own with respect to gender, age, or race. Ownership of an outgroup body has been found to be associated with a significant reduction in implicit biases against that outgroup. We propose that these changes occur via a process of self association that first takes place in the physical, bodily domain as an increase in perceived physical similarity between self and outgroup member. This self association then extends to the conceptual domain, leading to a generalization of positive self-like associations to the outgroup.},

Four alternative virtual rooms were designed to elicit four possible arousal-valence combinations, as described in each quadrant of the Circumplex Model of Affects. An experiment involving the recording of the electroencephalography (EEG) and electrocardiography (ECG) of sixty participants was carried out. A set of features was extracted from these signals using various state-of-the-art metrics that quantify brain and cardiovascular linear and nonlinear dynamics, which were input into a Support Vector Machine classifier to predict the subject's arousal and valence perception. The model's accuracy was 75.00{\%} along the arousal dimension and 71.21{\%} along the valence dimension. Our findings validate the use of Immersive Virtual Environments to elicit and automatically recognize different emotional states from neural and cardiac dynamics; this development could have novel applications in fields as diverse as Architecture, Health, Education and Videogames.},

abstract = {This paper presents an exploratory study aiming at investigating the movement behavior of participants when immersed within a virtual crowd. Specifically, a crosswalk scenario was created in which a virtual crowd was scripted to cross the road once the traffic light turned green. Participants were also instructed to walk across the road to the opposite sidewalk. During that time, the assessment of participant movement behavior was captured by the use of objective measurements (time, speed, and deviation). Five density conditions (no density, low density, medium density, high density, and extreme density) were developed to investigate which had the greatest effect on the movement behavior of the participants. The results obtained indicated that the extreme density condition of the virtual crowd did indeed alter the movement behavior of participants to a significant degree. Given that density had the greatest effect on the movement behavior of participants, a follow-up study was also conducted that utilized the density findings and explored whether density can affect the speed and direction of participants. This was achieved through examining five speed conditions and six directional conditions. The follow-up study provided some evidence that during an extreme density condition the speed of the crowd also affects the movement behavior of participants. However, no alteration in human movement behavior was observed when examining the direction of the virtual crowd. Implications for future research are discussed.},

abstract = {A central question in neuroscience and psychology is how the mammalian brain represents the outside world and enables interaction with it. Significant progress on this question has been made in the domain of spatial cognition, where a consistent network of brain regions that represent external space has been identified in both humans and rodents. In rodents, much of the work to date has been done in situations where the animal is free to move about naturally. By contrast, the majority of work carried out to date in humans is static, due to limitations imposed by traditional laboratory based imaging techniques. In recent years, significant progress has been made in bridging the gap between animal and human work by employing Virtual Reality (VR) technology to simulate aspects of real-world navigation. Despite this progress, the VR studies often fail to fully simulate important aspects of real-world navigation, where information derived from self-motion is integrated with representations of environmental features and task goals. In the current review, we provide a brief overview of animal and human imaging work to date, focusing on commonalties and differences in findings across species. Following on from this we discuss VR studies of spatial cognition, outlining limitations and developments, before introducing mobile brain imaging techniques and describe technical challenges and solutions for real-world recording. Finally, we discuss how these advances in mobile brain imaging technology, provide an unprecedented opportunity to illuminate how the brain represents complex multifaceted information during naturalistic navigation.},

Research in the human neurosciences often involves the use of simple and static stimuli lacking many of the potentially important aspects of real world activities and interactions. While this research is valuable, there is a growing interest in the human neurosciences to use cues about target states in the real world via multimodal scenarios that involve visual, semantic, and prosodic information. These scenarios should include dynamic stimuli presented concurrently or serially in a manner that allows researchers to assess the integrative processes carried out by perceivers over time. Furthermore, there is growing interest in contextually embedded stimuli that can constrain participant interpretations of cues about a target's internal states. Virtual reality environments proffer assessment paradigms that combine the experimental control of laboratory measures with emotionally engaging background narratives to enhance affective experience and social interactions.

Virtual reality is a technology that allows for the creation of fully interactive, three-dimensional computerized models of social situations that can be fully controlled by the experimenter. Furthermore, the introduction of interactive virtual characters—either driven by a human or by a computer—allows the researcher to test, in a systematic and independent manner, the effects of various social cues. We first introduce key technical features and concepts related to virtual reality. Next, we discuss the potential of this technology for enhancing social neuroscience protocols, drawing on illustrative experiments from the literature.},

abstract = {Background: In recent years, analyses of event related potentials/fields have moved from the selection of a few components and peaks to a mass-univariate approach in which the whole data space is analyzed. Such extensive testing increases the number of false positives and correction for multiple comparisons is needed. Method: Here we review all cluster-based correction for multiple comparison methods (cluster-height, cluster-size, cluster-mass, and threshold free cluster enhancement - TFCE), in conjunction with two computational approaches (permutation and bootstrap). Results: Data driven Monte-Carlo simulations comparing two conditions within subjects (two sample Student's t-test) showed that, on average, all cluster-based methods using permutation or bootstrap alike control well the family-wise error rate (FWER), with a few caveats. Conclusions: (i) A minimum of 800 iterations are necessary to obtain stable results; (ii) below 50 trials, bootstrap methods are too conservative; (iii) for low critical family-wise error rates (e.g. p=. 1{\%}), permutations can be too liberal; (iv) TFCE controls best the type 1 error rate with an attenuated extent parameter (i.e. power. {\textless}. 1).},

With virtual reality (VR) applications, for example, many measures of mental workload (e.g., secondary tasks) are highly intrusive and can distort what is being measured. In this paper we investigate the entropy of controller movements as an indicator of mental effort that can be measured unobtrusively. We report a proof-of-concept study that manipulates the experienced mental effort using the popular ecrossing task. As expected, the results show that entropy is increased for people with higher mental effort than for people with lower mental effort and that there is a positive relationship with NASA-TLX scores, the benchmark questionnaire for mental effort. Thus, intelligent user interfaces become capable of detecting mental effort in VR on the basis of controller entropy and could recognize when users need assistance in their decision making.},

This study investigated the relationship between prior video game experience and spatial performance in virtual and real environments. Across two experiments, gaming experience was related to performance in desktop virtual environments; those with more video game experience were more accurate in pointing to nonvisible targets. In contrast, gaming experience was unrelated to three different real environment tasks, suggesting that video games may primarily influence perceptual and cognitive abilities in the visual domain over abilities that also involve kinesthetic or vestibular input. Contrary to expectations, gaming experience was also related to performance in immersive virtual environments, which may be related to the use of a joystick interface during immersive travel. Video game experience was also positively related to performance in a dynamic spatial task and to verbal SAT and math SAT scores. Sex differences in desktop virtual navigation and dynamic spatial ability were eliminated when game experience was included as a covariate. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We are interested in studying what are the differences in human locomotor behavior between the real world and the VR scenario. For that purpose, participants performed the experiment in both the real and the virtual scenarios. For the VR case, participants can see both their own animated avatar and the avatar of the other participant in the environment. As they move, we store their trajectories to obtain information regarding speeds, clearance distances and task completion times. For the VR scenario, we also wanted to evaluate whether the users were aware of subtle differences in the avatar's animations and foot steps sounds. We ran the same experiment under three different conditions: (1) synchronizing the avatar's feet animation and sound of footsteps with the movement of the participant; (2) synchronizing the animation but not the sound and finally (3) not synchronizing either one. The results show significant differences in user's presence questionnaires and also different trends in their locomotor behavior between the real world and the VR scenarios. However the subtle differences in animations and sound tested in our experiment had no impact on the results of the presence questionnaires, although it showed a small impact on their locomotor behavior in terms of time to complete their tasks, and clearance distances kept while crossing paths.},

This model was tested with 89 users who performed an aeronautical assembly task in VR. Results suggest that intention to use VR is positively influenced by perceived usefulness and negatively influenced by cybersickness. Hedonic quality-stimulation and personal innovativeness are predictors of perceived usefulness. Perceived ease of use does not have a significant impact on intention to use and it is only influenced by pragmatic quality.

abstract = {Current virtual reality (VR) technologies have enormous potential to allow humans to experience computer-generated immersive virtual environments (IVEs). Many of these IVEs support near-natural audiovisual stimuli similar to the stimuli generated in our physical world. However, decades of VR research have been devoted to exploring and understand differences between perception and action in such IVEs compared to real-world perception and action. Although, significant differences have been revealed for spatiotemporal perception between IVEs and the physical world such as distance underestimation, there is still a scarcity of knowledge about the reasons for such perceptual discrepancies, in particular regarding the perception of temporal durations in IVEs. In this article, we explore the effects of manipulated zeitgebers, cognitive load and immersion on time estimation as yet unexplored factors of spatiotemporal perception in IVEs. We present an experiment in which we analyze human sensitivity to temporal durations while experiencing an immersive head-mounted display (HMO) environment. We found that manipulations of external zeitgebers caused by a natural or unnatural movement of the virtual sun had a significant effect on time judgments. Moreover, using the dual-task paradigm the results show that increased spatial and verbal cognitive load resulted in a significant shortening of judged time as well as an interaction with the external zeitgebers. Finally, we discuss the implications for the design of near-natural computer-generated virtual worlds.},

abstract = {In this paper, I address the question as to why participants tend to respond realistically to situations and events portrayed within an immersive virtual reality system. The idea is put forward, based on the experience of a large number of experimental studies, that there are two orthogonal components that contribute to this realistic response. The first is 'being there', often called 'presence', the qualia of having a sensation of being in a real place. We call this place illusion (PI). Second, plausibility illusion (Psi) refers to the illusion that the scenario being depicted is actually occurring. In the case of both PI and Psi the participant knows for sure that they are not 'there' and that the events are not occurring. PI is constrained by the sensorimotor contingencies afforded by the virtual reality system. Psi is determined by the extent to which the system can produce events that directly relate to the participant, the overall credibility of the scenario being depicted in comparison with expectations. We argue that when both PI and Psi occur, participants will respond realistically to the virtual reality. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Royal Society.},

abstract = {A new definition of immersion with respect to virtual environment (VE) systems has been proposed in earlier work, based on the concept of simulation. One system (A) is said to be more immersive than another (B) if A can be used to simulate an application as if it were running on B. Here we show how this concept can be used as the basis for a psychophysics of presence in VEs, the sensation of being in the place depicted by the virtual environment displays (Place Illusion, PI), and also the illusion that events occurring in the virtual environment are real (Plausibility Illusion, Psi). The new methodology involves matching experiments akin to those in color science. Twenty participants first experienced PI or Psi in the initial highest level immersive system, and then in 5 different trials chose transitions from lower to higher order systems and declared a match whenever they felt the same level of PI or Psi as they had in the initial system. In each transition they could change the type of illumination model used, or the field-of-view, or the display type (powerwall or HMD) or the extent of self-representation by an avatar. The results showed that the 10 participants instructed to choose transitions to attain a level of PI corresponding to that in the initial system tended to first choose a wide field-of-view and headmounted display, and then ensure that they had a virtual body that moved as they did. The other 10 in the Psi group concentrated far more on achieving a higher level of illumination realism, although having a virtual body representation was important for both groups. This methodology is offered as a way forward in the evaluation of the responses of people to immersive virtual environments, a unified theory and methodology for psychophysical measurement.},

abstract = {This paper discusses factors that may contribute to the participant's sense of presence in immersive virtual environments. We distinguish between external factors, that is those wholly determined by the hardware and software technology employed to generate the environment, and subjective factors, that is how sensory inputs to the human participant are processed internally. The therapeutic technique known as neuro-linguistic programming (NLP) is used as a basis for measuring such internal factors. NLP uses the idea of representation systems (visual, auditory and kinesthetic) and perceptual position (egocentric or exocentric) to code subjective experience. The paper also considers one external factor, that is how the virtual environment represents a participant - either as a complete body, or just an arrow cursor that responds to hand-movements. A case- control pilot experiment is described, where the controls have self-representation as an arrow cursor, and the experimental group subjects as a simple virtual body. Measurements of subjects' preferred representation systems and perceptual positions are obtained based on counts of types of predicates and references used in essays written after the experiment. These, together with the control variable (possession/absence of a virtual body) are used as explanatory variables in a regression analysis, with reported sense of presence as the dependent variable. Although tentative and exploratory in nature, the data analysis does suggest a relationship between reported sense of presence, preferred representation system, perceptual position, and an interaction effect between these and the virtual body factor.},

abstract = {The use of a self-avatar inside an immersive virtual reality system has been shown to have important effects on presence, interaction and perception of space. Based on studies from linguistics and cognition, in this paper we demonstrate that a self-avatar may aid the participant's cognitive processes while immersed in a virtual reality system. In our study participants were asked to memorise pairs of letters, perform a spatial rotation exercise and then recall the pairs of letters. In a between-subject factor they either had an avatar or not, and in a within-subject factor they were instructed to keep their hands still or not. We found that participants who both had an avatar and were allowed to move their hands had significantly higher letter pair recall. There was no significant difference between the other three conditions. Further analysis showed that participants who were allowed to move their hands, but could not see the self-avatar, usually didn't move their hands or stopped moving their hands after a short while. We argue that an active self-avatar may alleviate the mental load of doing the spatial rotation exercise and thus improve letter recall. The results are further evidence of the importance of an appropriate self-avatar representation in immersive virtual reality.},

abstract = {In the last years, gait phase partitioning has come to be a challenging research topic due to its impact on several applications related to gait technologies. A variety of sensors can be used to feed algorithms for gait phase partitioning, mainly classifiable as wearable or non-wearable. Among wearable sensors, footswitches or foot pressure insoles are generally considered as the gold standard; however, to overcome some inherent limitations of the former, inertial measurement units have become popular in recent decades. Valuable results have been achieved also though electromyography, electroneurography, and ultrasonic sensors. Non-wearable sensors, such as opto-electronic systems along with force platforms, remain the most accurate system to perform gait analysis in an indoor environment. In the present paper we identify, select, and categorize the available methodologies for gait phase detection, analyzing advantages and disadvantages of each solution. Finally, we comparatively examine the obtainable gait phase granularities, the usable computational methodologies and the optimal sensor placements on the targeted body segments.},

However, they raise several questions about the spatial behaviors to be displayed by virtual characters, and about the perception of virtual characters by users. We designed a location-aware virtual agent that adapts its spatial behavior to users' and objects' locations during a search task in a smart room. We conducted an experimental evaluation comparing this adaptive agent with an agent that does not perceive nor use the location of users and objects. The location-aware adaptive agent elicited higher levels of perceived presence and perceived adaptivity. Furthermore, performance was less influenced by task difficulty when users interacted with the adaptive agent. Such results can be useful for the design of future location-aware virtual agents. {\textcopyright} 2011 ACM.},

abstract = {There is evidence that adding motion-tracked avatars to virtual environments increases users' sense of presence. High quality motion capture systems are cost sensitive for the average user and low cost resource-constrained systems introduce various forms of error to the tracking. Much research has looked at the impact of particular kinds of error, primarily latency, on factors such as body ownership, but it is still not known what level of tracking error is permissible in these systems to afford compelling social interaction. This paper presents a series of experiments employing a sizable subject pool (n=96) that study the impact of motion tracking errors on user experience for activities including social interaction and virtual object manipulation. Diverse forms of error that arise in tracking are examined, including latency, popping (jumps in position), stuttering (positions held in time) and constant noise. The focus is on error on a person's own avatar, but some conditions also include error on an interlocutor, which appears underexplored. The picture that emerges is complex. Certain forms of error impact performance, a person's sense of embodiment , enjoyment and perceived usability, while others do not. Notably, evidence was not found that tracking errors impact social presence, even when those errors are severe.},

abstract = {S-PLUS is a powerful environment for the statistical and graphical analysis of data. It provides the tools to implement many statistical ideas which have been made possible by the widespread availability of workstations having good graphics and computational capabilities. This book is a guide to using S-PLUS to perform statistical analyses and provides both an introduction to the use of S-PLUS and a course in modern statistical methods. S-PLUS is available for both Windows and UNIX workstations, and both versions are covered in depth. The aim of the book is to show how to use S-PLUS as a powerful and graphical data analysis system. Readers are assumed to have a basic grounding in statistics, and so the book in intended for would-be users of S-PLUS and both students and researchers using statistics. Throughout, the emphasis is on presenting practical problems and full analyses of real data sets. Many of the methods discussed are state-of-the-art approaches to topics such as linear, nonlinear, and smooth regression models, tree-based methods, multivariate analysis and pattern recognition, survival analysis, time series and spatial statistics. Throughout, modern techniques such as robust methods, non-parametric smoothing, and bootstrapping are used where appropriate. This third edition is intended for users of S-PLUS 4.5, 5.0, 2000 or later, although S-PLUS 3.3/4 are also considered. The major change from the second edition is coverage of the current versions of S-PLUS. The material has been extensively rewritten using new examples and the latest computationally intensive methods. The companion volume on S Programming will provide an in-depth guide for those writing software in the S language. The authors have written several software libraries that enhance S-PLUS; these and all the datasets used are available on the Internet in versions for Windows and UNIX. There are extensive on-line complements covering advanced material, user-contributed extensions, further exercises, and new features of S-PLUS as they are introduced. Dr. Venables is now Statistician with CSRIO in Queensland, having been at the Department of Statistics, University of Adelaide, for many years previously. He has given many short courses on S-PLUS in Australia, Europe, and the USA. Professor Ripley holds the Chair of Applied Statistics at the University of Oxford, and is the author of four other books on spatial statistics, simulation, pattern recognition, and neural networks.},

In the present experiment we tested the stress-induction potential of a refined version of the TSST-VR using a fully orthogonal experimental design in which ninety-three healthy males were either assigned to the TSST condition or a corresponding control condition in a real or virtual environment. We found a significant increase of endocrine, autonomic and self-reported stress markers in both stress conditions. Notably, we found a robust rise in salivary cortisol to the TSST-VR comparable to that observed in the TSST-IV.

The dynamic nature of physiological data offers a continuous window to the users and allows a better understanding of their experience while interacting with a system. However, in order to be truly informative, physiological signals need to be closely linked to users' behaviors and interaction states. This paper presents an analysis method that provides a direct visual interpretation of users' physiological signals when interacting with an interface. The proposed physiological heatmap tool uses eyetracking data along with physiological signals to identify regions where users are experiencing different emotional and cognitive states with a higher frequency. The method was evaluated in an experiment with 44 participants. Results show that physiological heatmaps are able to identify emotionally significant regions within an interface better than standard gaze heatmaps. Applications of the method to different fields of HCI research are also discussed.},

However, triangulating the different data sources and visualizing them in an integrated manner such that they contextualize each other still proves challenging. Despite its potential value for gauging player behaviour, this area of research continues to be underexplored. In this paper, we propose a visualization approach that combines commonly tracked movement data with – from a visualization perspective rarely considered – gaze behaviour and emotional responses. We evaluated our approach through a qualitative expert study with ﬁve professional game developers. Our results show that both the individual visualization of gaze, emotions, and movement but especially their combination are valuable to understand and form hypotheses about player behaviour. At the same time, our results stress that careful attention needs to be paid to ensure that the visualization remains legible and does not obfuscate information.},

abstract = {Spatial cognitive processes can be based on distinct reference frames centered on the body (egocentric reference frame) or centered on aspects of the surrounding environment independent of the position and orientation of the cognizing subject (allocentric reference frame). Updating of spatial information based on an egocentric reference frame is often believed to be highly automatic while the computation of spatial information based on an allocentric reference frame is assumed to be effortful and dependent on prior egocentric space processing. In this position paper I will review theoretical and empirical work that challenges the view of such a hierarchical organization of spatial reference frames and propose an embodied view of spatial reference frame computation. This perspective is based on three interdependent aspects of spatial reference frames. First, based on the existence of neural structures that allow for an automatic computation of both, egocentric and allocentric spatial representations, a functional equivalence of distinct reference frames is proposed. Second, based on the assumption of efficient computation and parallel accessibility of distinct reference frames individual proclivities are proposed to develop based on environmental and socio-cultural influences. Finally, it is proposed that ontogenetic differences are manifest in anatomical changes associated with the dominant use of different reference frames. These changes influence the microgenesis of spatial knowledge and influence behavior in other spatial cognitive tasks. In conclusion, an embodied framework of spatial reference frames strongly suggests consideration of individual reference frame proclivities to gain further insights into the complex architecture of human spatial cognition. More importantly, neuroscientific approaches describing cortical networks and associated brain dynamics have to allow participants to actively move and behave in their environment to allow for investigating the cognitive processes and brain dynamics underlying embodied spatial cognition. {\textcopyright} 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

              implicitly track user experience. Their application in virtual
              and augmented reality (VR/AR) simulations is especially favorable
              as it allows user assessment without breaking the immersive
              experience. In VR, designing immersion is one key challenge.
              Subjective questionnaires are the established metrics to assess
              the effectiveness of immersive VR simulations. However,
              administering such questionnaires requires breaking the immersive
              experience they are supposed to assess.Approach. We present a
              complimentary metric based on a event-related potentials. For the
              metric to be robust, the neural signal employed must be reliable.
              Hence, it is beneficial to target the neural signal's cortical
              origin directly, efficiently separating signal from noise. To
              test this new complementary metric, we designed a reach-to-tap
              paradigm in VR to probe electroencephalography (EEG) and movement
              adaptation to visuo-haptic glitches. Our working hypothesis was,
              that these glitches, or violations of the predicted action
              outcome, may indicate a disrupted user experience.Main results.
              Using prediction error negativity features, we classified VR
              glitches with 77\% accuracy. We localized the EEG sources driving
              the classification and found midline cingulate EEG sources and a
              distributed network of parieto-occipital EEG sources to enable
              the classification success.Significance. Prediction error
              signatures from these sources reflect violations of user's
              predictions during interaction with AR/VR, promising a robust and

              central to survival in most animals. Studies in humans
              investigating the neural foundations of spatial navigation
              traditionally use stationary, desk-top protocols revealing the
              hippocampus, parahippocampal place area (PPA), and retrosplenial
              complex to be involved in navigation. However, brain dynamics,
              while freely navigating the real world remain poorly understood.
              To address this issue, we developed a novel paradigm, the
              AudioMaze, in which participants freely explore a room-sized
              virtual maze, while EEG is recorded synchronized to motion
              capture. Participants (n = 16) were blindfolded and explored
              different mazes, each in three successive trials, using their
              right hand as a probe to ``feel'' for virtual maze walls. When
              their hand ``neared'' a virtual wall, they received directional
              noise feedback. Evidence for spatial learning include shortening
              of time spent and an increase of movement velocity as the same
              maze was repeatedly explored. Theta-band EEG power in or near the
              right lingual gyrus, the posterior portion of the PPA, decreased
              across trials, potentially reflecting the spatial learning.
              Effective connectivity analysis revealed directed information
              flow from the lingual gyrus to the midcingulate cortex, which may
              indicate an updating process that integrates spatial information
              with future action. To conclude, we found behavioral evidence of
              navigational learning in a sparse-AR environment, and a neural
              correlate of navigational learning was found near the lingual

              the objective to build and foster a mental spatial representation

              touching otherwise invisible walls that were briefly rendered

              Following the Mobile Brain/Body Imaging approach, we aimed to

               not be established on the basis of postexperience presence
               questionnaires alone. To illustrate the point, an arbitrary
               mental attribute called ``colorfulness of the experience'' is
               conjured up, and a set of questions administered to 74
               respondents with an online questionnaire. The results suggested
               that colorfulness of yesterday's experiences was associated with
               the extent to which a person accomplished their tasks, and also
               associated with yesterday being a ``good'', ``pleasant'', but
               not frustrating day. The meaning lessness of this analysis
               illustrates that the equivalent methodology used by presence
               researchers, may, similarly, bring into being the idea of
               presence in the minds of VE participants. However, it is argued
